# snek
Single and two player snek games. I wanted to try out the pygame module. I'm using python after all, it's only appropriate to make a game that's based on snakes.

## Requirements
Python 3.7

Pygame module (run "pip3 install pygame" or "pip install pygame")

Only tested on Windows

## snek.py
Single player game of snake

Move with arrow keys. Edit file to change speed, window size, number of tiles, etc.

## snek2.py
Dual player game of snake

Left snake moves with WASD, right snake moves with arrow keys.

Edit file to change speed, window size, number of tiles, food spawn rate, colors, etc.
